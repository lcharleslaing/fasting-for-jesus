      <div id="scriptureText" class="overflow-y-auto max-h-96 text-left">
        <p><strong>Matthew 6:16-18 (NIV)</strong><br>
          "When you fast, do not look somber as the hypocrites do, for they disfigure their faces to show others they
          are fasting. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. But when you fast, put oil on your
          head and wash your face, so that it will not be obvious to others that you are fasting, but only to your
          Father, who is unseen; and your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you."</p>

        <p><strong>Isaiah 58:6 (NIV)</strong><br>
          "Is not this the kind of fasting I have chosen: to loose the chains of injustice and untie the cords of the
          yoke, to set the oppressed free and break every yoke?"</p>

        <p><strong>Joel 2:12-13 (NIV)</strong><br>
          "Even now," declares the Lord, "return to me with all your heart, with fasting and weeping and mourning." Rend
          your heart and not your garments. Return to the Lord your God, for he is gracious and compassionate, slow to
          anger and abounding in love, and he relents from sending calamity.</p>

        <p><strong>Matthew 4:2 (NIV)</strong><br>
          After fasting forty days and forty nights, he was hungry.</p>

        <p><strong>Ezra 8:21-23 (NIV)</strong><br>
          There, by the Ahava Canal, I proclaimed a fast, so that we might humble ourselves before our God and ask him
          for a safe journey for us and our children, with all our possessions. I was ashamed to ask the king for
          soldiers and horsemen to protect us from enemies on the road, because we had told the king, "The gracious hand
          of our God is on everyone who looks to him, but his great anger is against all who forsake him." So we fasted
          and petitioned our God about this, and he answered our prayer.</p>

        <p><strong>Acts 13:2-3 (NIV)</strong><br>
          While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, "Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for
          the work to which I have called them." So after they had fasted and prayed, they placed their hands on them
          and sent them off.</p>

        <p><strong>Nehemiah 1:4 (NIV)</strong><br>
          When I heard these things, I sat down and wept. For some days I mourned and fasted and prayed before the God
          of heaven.</p>

        <p><strong>Daniel 9:3 (NIV)</strong><br>
          So I turned to the Lord God and pleaded with him in prayer and petition, in fasting, and in sackcloth and
          ashes.</p>

        <p><strong>Esther 4:16 (NIV)</strong><br>
          "Go, gather together all the Jews who are in Susa, and fast for me. Do not eat or drink for three days, night
          or day. I and my attendants will fast as you do. When this is done, I will go to the king, even though it is
          against the law. And if I perish, I perish."</p>

        <p><strong>Psalm 35:13 (NIV)</strong><br>
          Yet when they were ill, I put on sackcloth and humbled myself with fasting. When my prayers returned to me
          unanswered,</p>
